A:I'm Bell. I'm in Room 908. Can you change the room for me? It's too noisy. My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made. She said it was too much for her.

我叫贝尔，住在908号房间。能给我换个房间吗?这儿太吵了，我妻子被行李电梯声音吵醒了几次。她说她真受不了了。|

B:I'm awfully sorry, sir. I do apologize Room 908 is at the end of the corridor. It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet.

对不起，先生，我向您道歉。908 房间在走廊尽头。噪音在宁静的早晨可能会扰人。

Anyhow, I'd like to change our room.

无论如何，我们要换房。

No problem, sir. We'll manage it, but we don't have any spare room today. Could you wait till tomorrow? The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning. There'll be some rooms for you to choose from.

没问题，先生。我们会尽力办到，但是今天我们没有 空余房间。您能等到明天吗?明天早上，美国教育代表团的人就要离开。会有一些房间任您挑选的。

All right. I hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep.

好的。我希望明天晩上我们能好好地睡上一觉。
