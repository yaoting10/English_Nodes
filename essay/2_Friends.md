### How to Accept That Friends Change Over Times

如何接受友情随着时间的推移而改变 （有些朋友，走着走着就散了）

Sometimes, accepting that your friends change as you get older isn't easy. Indeed(事实上), although it's a natural occurence, you might not always accept it.

有时候，接受你的朋友随着年龄的长大而改变并不容易，事实上，尽管这是自然发生的事，你可能并不总是接受它。

This is completely(非常) normal. After all（毕竟）, over time, friends come and go. That said, true friends endure over the years.

这是非常正常的，毕竟久而久之，朋友来了又走，也就是说，真正的友谊是经久不衰的。

However, sometimes, even friends that you considered were 'for life', also leave, or the friendship takes on a new form - one that's not so enriching and that you don't like so much.

但是，有时甚至你认为可以陪伴终身的朋友也会离开，又或者你们的友谊会进入到新的形势，这种友谊既不浓郁，你也不再需要。

Among the causes of this are the vital dynamics of the friendships themselves. For instance, a change of city or job , new obligations, and responsibilities, loss of contact over time and distance, time self, or other important changes in your life or yourself.

造成这种情况的原因之一是友谊的重要动力。比如，城市或工作的改变，新的责任，新的义务，随着时间和距离而失去联系，时间本身，或者你的生活或你自己的其他重要变化。

Or, maybe you've grown and matured in a different way from your friends.So,how should you approach this kind of situation?

或者，也许你的成长和成熟方式与你的朋友不同，那么，你应该如何处理这种情况呢？

Think about it: is it really new to you?

想一想，这种情况是最近才发生的吗？

If you look at the situation with hindsight and in a slightly detached way, you'll probably realize that the loss of your friendship has been gradually happening over the years. It hasn't suddenly occurred.

如果你以一种有点超然的方式来看待这种情况，你可能会意识到，友谊的流失是在这些年里逐渐发生的。它没有突然发生。

It's been a progressive process.Maybe you didn't see each other so much anymore and talked to each other less. Or, perhaps you no longer live in the same area.

它是一个循序渐进的过程，也许你们已经很久没有见过面也没有说过话了，也许你们没有在同一个地方生活了。
