### How to Accept That Friends Change Over Times

如何接受友情随着时间的推移而改变 （有些朋友，走着走着就散了）

Sometimes, accepting that your friends change as you get older isn't easy. Indeed(事实上), although it's a natural occurence, you might not always accept it.

有时候，接受你的朋友随着年龄的长大而改变并不容易，事实上，尽管这是自然发生的事，你可能并不总是接受它。

This is completely(非常) normal. After all（毕竟）, over time, friends come and go. That said, true friends endure over the years.

这是非常正常的，毕竟久而久之，朋友来了又走，也就是说，真正的友谊是经久不衰的。

However, sometimes, even friends that you considered were 'for life', also leave, or the friendship takes on a new form - one that's not so enriching and that you don't like so much.
