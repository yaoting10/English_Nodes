### 定语从句:

一个句子作定语，修饰限定名词

He is the *我梦想得到的* job.

This is the job. 				

I have dreamed of the job for years.

This is the **job** **which** I have dreamed of for years.

先行词     关系词



修饰限定名词，作定语从句，要放在所修饰的名词后面。

连接词作成份，起到连接的作用

| 先行词    | 关系词        |
| --------- | ------------- |
| 物        | Which/that    |
| 人        | Who/whom/that |
| 人的/物的 | Whose         |
| 时间      | When          |
| 地点      | where         |
| 原因      | why           |

注意事项：

1. 定语从句中每个关系词都作成份（包括that）
2. Whom 指人时只能作宾语, who/that 都行， 指物的 which/that可以互换
3. 定语从句中关系词作宾语可以省略。
